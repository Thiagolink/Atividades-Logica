EXERCISE 3.18

  Sentences 3.18  (Student file: "Sentences 3.18.sen")
     We found problems in your sentences:
     -NOTE:  Your goal in this exercise is to find a sentence that is true in 
      exactly the same worlds as the odd-numbered sentence, but you can't use 
      the same predicate used in that sentence.  For example, if the original 
      sentence is "SameRow(a, b)", you can't use "SameRow" in your answer.  
      Make sure your sentence doesn't say either too much or too little.  (For 
      example, to express "SameShape(a, b)", the sentence "Tet(a) & Tet(b)" 
      says too much, since the original sentence is true of two dodecs, too.)
     *** Your sixth sentence, "~(a # d)", is not equivalent to any of the 
         expected answers.  This one is a bit tricky.  You need to find a 
         sentence that doesn't use identity, but which can't be true of two 
         different blocks in Tarski's World.
     *** Your second sentence, "~(FrontOf(a,b) & BackOf(a,b))", is not 
         equivalent to any of the expected answers.
     *** Your fourth sentence, "~(RightOf(d,b) & LeftOf(d,b))", is not 
         equivalent to any of the expected answers.
     *** Your tenth answer, "(Tet(a) & Tet(b)) v (Cube(a) & (Cube(b)) v 
         (Dodec(a) & Dodec(b))", isn't well formed.

EXERCISE 3.21

  Sentences 3.21  (Student file: "Sentences 3.21.sen")
     We found problems in your sentences:
     -NOTE: You seem to be having trouble translating 'neither...nor'; you 
      should reread the discussion of this in the textbook.
     *** Your fourth sentence, "(Cube(d) & Cube(c)) v ~(Small(d) & Small(c))", 
         is not equivalent to any of the expected translations.
     *** Your fifth sentence, "~(RightOf(e,c) & RightOf(a,c)) v ~(LeftOf(e,b) & 
         LeftOf(a,b))", is not equivalent to any of the expected translations.  
         This English sentence can be confusing.  Try translating "e is to the 
         right of c and to the left of b" and "a is to the right of c and to 
         the left of b".  Then say that neither of these is the case.
     *** Your seventh sentence, "~Between(c,a,b) v ~(FrontOf(c,a) & 
         FrontOf(c,b))", is not equivalent to any of the expected translations. 
         Try paraphrasing the original sentence without using "neither...nor," 
         then see if you can translate your paraphrase.
     *** Your ninth sentence, "~(FrontOf(d,c) & FrontOf(c,c)) v ~(FrontOf(d,b) 
         & FrontOf(c,b))", is not equivalent to any of the expected


 
 
         translations.  Try paraphrasing the original sentence without using 
         "neither...nor," then see if you can translate your paraphrase.  
         Ignore the fact that "c" appears twice in the sentence; that's 
         irrelevant.  Think about other sentences with the same form, for 
         example, "Neither Clinton nor Gore is taller than either Michael 
         Jordan or Magic Johnson."  How would you say that in FOL?

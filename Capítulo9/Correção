     -NOTE: In these translations, it's essential that you use the right 
      predicates, function symbols, and constants.  (Remember "Square" and "2" 
      are not part of the language.  "<" is part of the language, but ">" is 
      not.)  To enter the multiplication symbol, you must type the asterisk 
      (*), not "x", which is a variable.
     *** Your fourth sentence, "Ay ((Prime(y) & y # 2) -> ~Even(y * y)) ",


 
         doesn't match the expected translation.
